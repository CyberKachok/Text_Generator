What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
How close did you get?
Close as any man would.
We should head back to the wall.
Do the dead frighten you?
Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.
You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
They were here.
See where they went.
What is it?
It's …
Go on. Father's watching.
And your mother.
Fine work, as always. Well done.
Thank you.
I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. … Quite beautiful … the stitching …
And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.
Don't think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
Quick, Bran, faster!
Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.
Get the lads to saddle their horses.
Do you have to?
He swore an oath, Cat.
The law is law, my lady.
Tell Bran he's coming, too.
Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
Lad, go run back and get the rest.
White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.
I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.
nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block.
Forgive me, lord.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …
Don't look away.
King of the Andals and the First Men …
Father will know if you do.
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
You did well.
You understand why I did it?
Jon said he was a deserter.
But do you understand why I had to kill him?
Our way is the old way?
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
So he was lying?
A madman sees what he sees.
What is it?
Mountain lion?
There are no mountain lions in these woods.
It's a freak.
It's a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
Where will they go? Their mother's dead.
They don't belong down here.
Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
Right. Give it here.
NO!
Put away your blade.
I take orders from your father, not you.
Please, father!
I'm sorry, Bran.
Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
What about you?
I'm not a Stark. Get on.
What is it?
The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.
As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you
And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.
What if Jon Arryn told someone?
But who would he tell?
My husband.
If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.
You should be the Hand of the king.
That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.
I wonder if the old gods agree.
It's your gods with all the rules.
I am so sorry, my love.
Tell me.
There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
Your sister. The boy …
They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.
You can always say no, Ned.
We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
I'm told he drinks all night.
How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.
In any case, candles.
Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!
I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!
How many times have I told you
But he's coming right now! Down our road!
I want you to promise me
I promise.
D'you know what?
What?
You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?
Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]
Move!
Your Grace.
You've got fat.
Cat!
Your Grace.
Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
Where's the Imp?
Will you shut up?
Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?
Arya.
Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.
That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
Would you please shut up.
My queen.
My queen.
Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.
Ned.
Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
Tell me about Jon Arryn.
One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.
We both did.
He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.
Aye.
Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.
I'm not worthy of the honor.
I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.
Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
I did hear something about that.
And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
And the other brother?
The queen has two brothers?
There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
I hear they call him the Imp.
I hear he hates that nickname.
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
Clever girl.
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
Have you?
The gods gave me one blessing.
Don't get up.
M'lord.
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.
She has odd cravings, our sister.
A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.
I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.
Close the door!
Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
She belonged with me.
In my dreams, I kill him every night.
It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.
Not all of them.
Daenerys!
Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?
We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
No.
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.
It's too hot, my lady.
Where is he?
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.
Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.
Come forward, my dear.
Where's he going?
The ceremony is over.
But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?
Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.
It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
When will they be married?
Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
Is it true they lie with their horses?
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
Do you take me for a fool?
I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.
I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?
I don't know.
We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.
Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
He's so handsome.
When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
Sansa…
Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.
Is he dead yet?
Uncle Benjen!
You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
So take me with you when you go back.
Jon…
Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.
The Wall isn't going anywhere.
I'm ready to swear your oath.
You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
I don't care about that.
You might, if you knew what it meant. … I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
What're you doing back there?
Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?
Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.
The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.
He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.
The two he was with are still missing.
A wildling ambush.
Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.
Winter is coming.
Uncle Benjen.
Robb boy. How are ye?
I'm good.
Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
Yes. Lovely country.
I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?
Thirteen, Your Grace.
You're tall. Still growing?
I think so, Your Grace.
And have you bled yet?
No, Your Grace.
And your dress. Did you make it?
Such talent. You must make something for me.
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
I hear the same.
Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
Your pardon.
I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.
I don't fight in tournaments.
No? Getting a little old for it?
I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.
Well said.
Arya!
Time for bed.
I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.
I won't let him take you.
The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.
I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'
How did he get so fat?
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.
Send him in.
Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.
Stay.
This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
What news?
She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?
If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?
They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.
He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
A different time. Different king.
When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.
When?
When their omens favor war.
I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.
Thank you, Magister.
She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
Make him happy.
No.
Do you know the Common Tongue?
Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
Rough night, Imp?
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.
I didn't pick you for a hunter.
The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
It's not hunting if you pay for it.
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
No, but I'm still better than you.
I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.
I hope I'll serve you well.
You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!
Come on, you.
Stop. STOP.
Are you completely mad?
He saw us.
It's all right. It's all right.
He saw us!
I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?
Ten
Ten.
The things I do for love.
You need to drink, child... And eat.
Isn't there anything else?
The Dothraki have two things in abundance
Khaleesi!
Your hands.
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
As you wish, your Grace.
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?
Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.
Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
What good will my sympathies do them?
None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
One word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!
Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?
You can't...
Do you understand?
The Prince will remember that, little lord.
I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...
Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.
Little brother.
Beloved siblings.
Is Bran going to die?
Apparently not.
What do you mean?
The Maester says the boy may live.
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
Please.
I would have dressed, your Grace.
This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful..
Perhaps this time she'll listen.
A sword for the wall?
I already have one.
Good man. Have you swung it yet?
Of course I have.
At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?
Soon enough.
Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.
Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
It's good you've got help.
Watch. Nymeria, gloves.
Impressive.
Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!
I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
A present?
Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
It's so skinny.
So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
I can be quick.
You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
I think so.
First lesson
I know which end to use.
I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.
Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
I came to say goodbye to Bran.
You've said it.
I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.
I want you to leave.
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
I have no choice.
That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.
You can. You must.
You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
You Starks are hard to kill.
My mother?
She was very kind.
Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
It was always my color.
Farewell, Snow.
And you, Stark.
There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.
Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.
Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
I've half a mind to go with you.
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
You should have asked me 20 years ago.
There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.
I recall a few chances.
There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Bessie. She was one of yours.
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?
Wylla.
That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Nor will I.
We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
She's little more than a child.
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
Tell me we're not speaking of this.
Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Why do you read so much?
Look at me and tell me what you see.
Is this a trick?
What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
Until your brother killed that King.
Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.
The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...
I don't care about appointments!
I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Very good, my Lord. My Lady.
When was the last time you left this room?
I have to take care of him.
He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...
Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
No!
Have you ever seen a dragon?
Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Everywhere? Even in the east?
No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
It is known.
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
The moon?
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
How old were you?
I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Nine?!
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Yes.
Will it take three years?
No.
Welcome.
What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
The boy was always sure-footed before.
Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
Saw what, my lady?
I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.
They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
I'll ride to King's Landing.
No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
Mother, you can't.
I must.
I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
What about Bran?
I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Finish a man?
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
Pardon me, Ser.
Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.
Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
I'll get you!
Arya!
What are you doing here? Go away.
Your sister? And who are you, boy?
Mycah, my Lord.
He the butcher's boy.
He's my friend.
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
Stop it!
Arya, stay out of this.
I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Nymeria!
Please don't.
Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
Then go! Don't touch me.
The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
It's a direwolf.
I'll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
Go!
My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
Where is she?
She's been taken directly before the King.
Who took her?
The Lannisters found her.
Right, get back.
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
Back! Back to the inn. All back!
I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?
No.
It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
That's not what happened!
Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
Liar!
Shut up!
Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?
In bed asleep.
She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.
Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.
I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
Liar! Liar liar liar!
Stop it! That's enough of that.
Liar liar liar!
Stop! Arya!
She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
Gladly, your Grace.
And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
I'd forgot the damned wolf.
We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
So be it.
We have another wolf.
As you will.
You can't mean it.
A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!
Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
s this your command... your Grace?
Where is the beast?
Chained up outside, your Grace.
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
Is this some trick?
The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
He ran... Not very fast.
Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.
Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.
Yes, my Lord.
If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.
Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.
But you just stood there and watched.
500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.
Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
You served him well, when serving was safe.
Lord Stark.
Lord Varys.
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...
But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
Grand Maester.
How many years has it been? You were a young man.
And you served another King.
How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?
Without the King?
Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
We are the lords of small matters here.
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
Mmm, how much?
40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.
Can the treasury bear such expense?
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?
Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
How could you let this happen?
The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.
Counting coppers," he calls it.
I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.
There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.
You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.
Please, it's nearly healed.
It's ugly.
A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
Do I have to marry her?
Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.
I don't want to.
No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
How would you handle them?
I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.
A royal army?
Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.
And if the northerners rebel?
I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.
And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
For me. I'm their King.
But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
I'm not asking.
The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.
So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.
I'm practicing.
Practicing for what?
The Prince.
Arya, stop!
He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
The Hound killed your friend.
The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
You're an idiot.
You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
Enough!
What's happening here?
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
You've barely eaten a thing.
It's all right. Go on.
War was easier than daughters.
Go away!
Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?
Mine.
Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
Come here. Now what do you want with this?
It's called Needle.
A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
Stick 'em with the pointy end.
laughs] That's the essence of it.
I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.
I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.
Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
So was I! He is a liar.
Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.
But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
Winter is coming.
You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.
I don't hate her. Not really.
I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.
I can keep it?
Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
I hate your stories.
I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…
What are you telling him now?
Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
Maybe we do.
How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.
I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.
Don't ever say that.
I'd rather be dead.
Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.
It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
My Lady.
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?
I would. We've done nothing wrong.
We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...
Follow me, Lady Stark.
Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
A dear friend told me.
Lady Stark.
Lord Varys.
To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
How did you know I was coming?
Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.
Do you know whose dagger this is?
I must admit I do not.
Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.
Yours?
At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
To whom?
Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
Next!
Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.
A charming man.
I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
And how's that going, Commander Mormont?
Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
Good news or bad?
Both.
Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
My wife is in Winterfell.
Is she?
I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
You're a funny man. A very funny man.
Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.
You broke my nose, bastard!
It's an improvement.
If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.
I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
What're you looking at, halfman?
I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
What do you care about our faces?
It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
They hate me because I'm better than they are.
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
We have proof. We have the blade.
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.
I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
How could you be so stupid?
Calm down.
He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
Then what are you raving about?
What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
And my husband?
I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
Let me go.
Never.
The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
I wish I could see the girls.
It's too dangerous.
Just for a moment.
Until we know who our enemies are...
I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.
Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
And if you find the proof?
Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
He still loves you.
Does he?
Off with you.
It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
Of course, your Grace.
Who was it?
A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
How'd you do it?
Lance through the heart.
Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?
It's empty, your Grace.
What do you mean it's empty?
There's no more wine.
Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
Your outlaw... Any last words?
I cut his head off, so no.
What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...
The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
From whom?
If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices
Tell them all to stop.
You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
Until I command them otherwise.
You're learning to talk like a Queen.
Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
No!
Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.
Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?
You walk. [to Viserys]
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
You're leaving?
I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
What kind of reports?
The kind I don't want to believe.
m ready. I won't let you down.
You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.
But I'm better than every...
Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.
A bear's balls.
You're joking?
And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
And how do a bear's balls taste?
A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?
You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
Call me what you like.
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.
But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.
Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.
Enjoy the capital, brother.
I always do.
I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?
Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.
Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
Yes, Khaleesi.
What are you doing?
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion.
For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.
Armor.
Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
Slow.
Slow.
It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.
My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?
He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
There are no rabbits.
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?
Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
I don't think she wants to eat dog.
The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
A blessing from the Great Stallion.
She does not want to eat horse.
I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
Eight... no, nine.
All of them brief?
They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually
We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.
It's a boy.
How do you know?
I know.
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.
Of course.
He'll never walk again.
If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.
Farewell, My Lord.
You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
Who are you?
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.
It's too heavy.
It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
What if I drop it?
The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.
I'm a girl.
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...
A needle.
Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.
Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.
The little Lordo s been dreaming again.
We have visitors.
I don't want to see anyone.
Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
I don't want to go.
Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
He has no memory of that day.
Curious.
Why are you here?
Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
Kneel, Hodor.
Do you like to ride, Bran?
Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.
The boy has lost the use of his legs.
What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
I'm not a cripple.
Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
Will I really be able to ride?
You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.
Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.
He's not my master.
No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?
She wasn't feeling well.
She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?
My lady's whereabouts...
My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?
Must have been a pretty sight.
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.
We were outnumbered 10 to one.
A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.
Careful, Imp.
I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.
Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.
What in seven hells is that?
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
Tell them your name.
Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.
Come to take the black pudding.
Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.
I yield. Please, no more.
On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.
Enough! He yielded.
Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.
Are you sure you want to do this?
No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
Well fought!
Piss off.
Did he hurt you?
I've had worse.
You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.
Why didn't you get up and fight?
I wanted to. I just couldn't.
Why not?
I'm a coward. My father always says so.
The Wall's no place for cowards.
You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
You're too stupid to be a coward.
You're too stupid to be a...
Quick now, before summer's over.
Come on here!
Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.
These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
But if they did?
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
And you know these men?
I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.
You sold slaves.
Aye.
Why?
I had no money and an expensive wife.
And where is she now?
In another place, with another man.
Your Grace?
Yes, my dear?
They call you the last dragon...
They do.
You have dragon's blood in your veins?
It's entirely possible.
What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.
I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
Really? Why dragons?
They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
I was not locked in. I have seen things.
What have you seen?
I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
A pirate ship?
A dragon.
No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen
What happened to the skulls?
I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.
That's very sad.
Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?
No, your Grace. To teach your sister.
To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...
What if I have a girl?
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
What if I only have girls?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
But what if?
If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
And everyone would hate me.
Nobody could ever hate you.
Joffrey does.
Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
Please shut up about it.
Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
Aegon the Conqueror.
And who built the Red Keep?
Maegor the Cruel.
And how many years did it take to build...
My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
The Mad King.
Commonly known as the Mad King.
Why were they killed?
You should speak to your father about these matters.
I don't want to speak to my father, ever.
You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
No, I won't.
It's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.
The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
Dreadful.
If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
I need more men.
You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
I will?
You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.
Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.
The sooner this is over, the better.
The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?
This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.
I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
Why?
I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
What did Jon want the night before he died?
He came inquiring after a book.
A book? What book?
I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.
I'd like to read it.
The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained
As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Jon's death...
Such a tragedy.
Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating
The seed is strong"? What does that mean?
The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
What else could it be?
Poison.
A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?
Everybody knows that.
Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.
I've taken enough of your time.
No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...
Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
It's a hard fall down these steps.
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
Cats? Syrio says…
He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
He's right about that.
Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
He needs to get his strength back first.
He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?
No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
No. That's not me.
Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
No, that's all right. I'm fine.
You're not. You're freezing.
I don't like high places.
You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?
On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. "You're almost a man now," he said, "but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more." Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
I'm not going to get any better, you know?
Well… You can't get any worse.
I hear you're reading a boring book.
Pycelle talks too much.
He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
I promised Cat that I'd help you.
Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
Varys or the Queen?
No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Yes.
The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.
I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
As you can see, I'm busy.
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...
No "ser." I'm not a knight.
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.
A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.
Let them look.
The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
What did Lord Arryn want?
He always came to see the boy.
I'd like to see him as well.
As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
This is fine work.
It's not for sale.
Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...
I made it for me.
Forgive him, my Lord.
There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.
What kind of questions?
About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.
Your mother?
Who she was, what she looked like.
What did you tell him?
She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
Find anything?
King Robert's bastard son.
This is for the King from Lord Stark.
Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
Three? Four?
He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
Forgive me, my Lord...
Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
We've met before, you know.
Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
That's where you got your scar?
Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
Vicious sons of whores.
They like their bloodshed.
They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Theon? He's a good lad.
I doubt it.
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
I don't serve Lord Stark.
Where have you been?
Watch duty. With Sam.
Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
He wasn't hungry.
Impossible!
That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
No one touches Sam.
What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.
Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.
You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?
You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.
Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.
Yes, Khaleesi.
Why did you hit her?!
How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
What's this?
It's a gift. I had it made for you.
Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
Please.
This stinks of manure. All of it.
Stop - stop it.
You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.
You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
You do not talk back to me!
You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
I wouldn't doubt it.
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Sally on the side?
It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.
I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
I find that hard to believe.
I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...
You didn't know where to put it?
I know where to put it.
Was she... Old and ugly?
Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
What color hair?
Red.
I like red hair. And her... Her...
You don't want to know.
That good?
Better.
Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
What's my name?
Jon Snow?
And why is my surname Snow?
Because... You're a bastard from the north.
I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.
So... You didn't know where to put it?
Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.
It is a bit nippy.
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
I build my own fires.
That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.
I hit him. I hit the dragon.
Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
He is still the true King.
The truth now
No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
Home.
I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
Lover's quarrel?
I'm sorry. Do I...?
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...
An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
Why do they call you Littlefinger?
Arya!
Don't be rude!
No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
Gods, who is that?
Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
And his opponent?
Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.
No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.
My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.
Your Grace.
You're missing your tournament.
Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
She likes it here.
The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
What are you doing here?
I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
If that's my job, then so be it.
You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.
As was I.
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
And to you.
Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.
Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?
I'd rather throw myself down a well.
Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.
My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.
Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
You can have my room.
There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
Aye, my Lord.
My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Lady Stark.
I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
It is, my Lady.
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
She is.
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
Our lord is honored by his trust.
I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
Knight of House Frey
This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.
Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
He'd never worn this armor before.
Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
Who determines the draw?
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.
Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
Yes. That will never happen.
Robert tends to do what he wants.
If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
You're too fat for your armor.
Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?
Oh, it's funny, is it?
No, Your Grace.
No? You don't like the Hando s joke?
You're torturing the poor boy.
You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!
The breastplate stretcher?
How long before he figures it out?
Maybe you should have one invented.
All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
And who's going to hit you back?
Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
Aye.
Drink.
I'm not thirsty.
Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
Your squire... A Lannister boy?
Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
Robert?
What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!
Where's Arya
At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
Thank you, Ser Loras.
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Hey.
I can't watch.
100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
I'll take that bet.
Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
Or you could even buy a friend.
He's going to die.
Ser Loras rides well.
Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
No honor but quite a bit of gold.
Stop this madness in the name of your King!
I owe you my life, Ser.
I'm no Ser.
Remove his hood.
On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.
This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
I did... often and loudly.
Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
And why would I do that?
Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
Five years ago.
She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.
I am not a murderer, Lannister.
Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
The dagger found
What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Should I gag him?
Why? Am I starting to make sense?
My Lady, this way.
Untie me. If I die, what's the point?
Rodrik?
I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
Well, I'm willing if she is.
Bran...
The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - "We do not sow".
Lords?
The Greyjoys.
Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
And failed rebellions.
Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
Good.
Words - "Ours is the fury". Lords - the Baratheons.
The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
Hmm...
Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
Lords - the Lannisters.
We're still on their words.
I don't know them.
You do know them. Think.
Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
That's House Martell.
Righteous in wrath".
House Hornwood.
Family, duty, honor".
Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?
You know it is.
Family comes first?
Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
And then she left!
When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
Why did she leave?
I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
Do you know where she is now? Today?
No, I don't.
Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
I'll never shoot another arrow.
And where is that written?
You need legs to work a bow.
Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
Really?
Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
Important enough for the likes of you.
You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
Jealous?
Why should I be jealous?
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
Might surprise you.
Hmm?
He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
You are jealous.
I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
And what about the Starks?
I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
A “ward”, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…
My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
You're a very serious boy.
I'm not a boy.
Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.
I don't want to pay for it.
Then get yourself a wife.
Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
How is your son, my Lord?
He'll never walk again.
But his mind is sound?
So they say.
A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.
I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
I didn't trust you.
So why do you trust me now?
The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
What sort of doom does the King face?
The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
Who gave it to him?
Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
The squire, Ser Hugh?
Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
Someone who could afford it.
Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
He started asking questions.
He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
This Hand is not the other.
We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
It never was.
The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
You do move quietly.
We all have our qualities.
You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
Strictly speaking.
Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
Saw me with your own eyes?
Eyes I own.
Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
One shudders at the thought.
Oh.
But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
Have you?
Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
Was that you under the bed?
And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.
Oh, please.
To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
To a small council meeting?
Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
Off with you. No begging.
I'm not a beggar. I live here.
D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
I want to see my father.
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
They said they were going to kill you.
Who did?
I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
Oh, Arya.
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
Where did you hear this?
In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
What were you doing in the dungeons?
Chasing a cat.
Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
Your name, friend?
Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
I'm a girl!
Did Benjen send you?
No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
Know what?
Best said in private, my Lord.
Go on. We'll talk more later.
Jory, take her safely to her room.
Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.
How many guards does my father have?
Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
No fear on that count, little Lady.
Well?
It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.
You're far from home, Lady Stark.
To whom do I speak?
Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
There was no time to send word.
May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
He doesn't look like a prisoner.
My sister will decide what he looks like.
Yes, my Lady. She will at that.
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
I like you.
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
I need to see the King first -- alone.
The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.
Is it about my wife?
No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
The whore is pregnant.
You're speaking of murdering a child.
I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!
Then we're no better than the Mad King.
Careful, Ned. Careful now.
You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.
Based on whose information?
Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
We should have had them both killed years ago.
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
She dies.
I will have no part in it.
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!
I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
What can I do for you?
When do you return to Winterfell?
Why? What do you care?
If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
I don't have the time.
It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
Heward and Wyl.
Find them and meet me at the stables.
You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-
To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
Mommy? Is that the bad man?
It is.
He's little.
He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
Perhaps you will, my little love.
This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.
You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
You're jealous.
Are you sure this won't hurt?
Only if I slip.
And you prefer me like this?
Mhmm.
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
I want you.
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
Hold still.
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
Yes well, I guess we'll never know.
Everywhere?
Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
I have an outrageous amount of money.
Not as much as the Lannisters.
But a lot more than you.
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
Hmm... How did that ever happen?
Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
Do you know who should be King?
Be serious.
I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
I'm fourth in line.
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
Stannis?
Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
He's still my older brother.
What are you doing?!
Look at it.
You cut me!
It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.
You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.
The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
Is my father wrong?
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
We still outnumber them.
Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
Five.
Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
What do you want?
We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
Our marriage.
Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
Every day.
How long can hate hold a thing together?
Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it tis. What was she like?
You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
So why now?
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
I felt something for you once, you know?
I know.
Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?
No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
It doesn't make me feel anything.
She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.
I will.
And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
Well, he has more than you, for a start.
How many?
Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
Come.
Jory!
My Lord.
Such a small pack of wolves.
Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
I remember him well.
It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
If you threaten my Lord again...
Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.
Your pardon, your Grace.
Do you know what your wife has done?
She did nothing I did not command.
Who'd have thought she had it in her?
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
I am the King's Hand -
You were the King's Hand!
trying to keep the peace -
You shall now be held accountable.
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
He butchered my men.
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
Quiet, woman.
Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
I took you for a king.
Hold your tongue.
He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
If we don't act… there will be a war.
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!
As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt.
The hunt?
Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.
The Targaryen girl -
Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.
Khaleesi?
Oh, Khaleesi!
You're hurt.
Not too fast.
Come on, Dancer.
When are you gonna tell him?
Not now.
Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
You're talking about war.
I'm talking about justice.
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.
Where's Bran?
I don't know. It's not my House.
Robb?
All alone in the deep dark woods.
I'm not alone, my brother is with me.
I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver.
We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
I can't. The saddle, the straps.
What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.
Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
Robb!
Shut up! Drop the blade!
No, don't.
Do it.
Are you all right?
Yes, it doesn't hurt.
Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.
Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
You don't have the right -
To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
What about her?
Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours.
We'll keep her alive.
Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
Dwarf man making noise!
How would you like to be rich?
Dwarf man still making noise.
My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold.
No gold!
Well, I don't have it here.
No gold! Fuck off.
I don't want to practice today.
No?
They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
You are troubled.
Yes -
Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
I don't like dolls and k -
You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens…
More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?
The old and the new.
There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - “Not today.”
She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.
She's doing well.
She'll never keep it down.
Tell me what she is saying.
The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
She's going to have a boy.
He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.
The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.
A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
They love her.
She truly is a queen today.
Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
It's not my law.
They don't belong to you.
Whatever is hers is also mine.
Once, perhaps.
If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.
And you have all three.
I need a large army… I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.
You can go, but you can't have the eggs.
You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
It means everything to me.
And yet here you stand?
And here I stand.
Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
Noise again!
About the gold -
Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
Where?
Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -
You want free? Go be free.
Have you ever heard the phrase Rich as a Lannister? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
What message?
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
You wish to confess your crimes?
Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.
Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -
Silence!
What happened next?!
What do you think you're doing?
Confessing my crimes.
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.
You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.
Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life.
I understand the law.
We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.
No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
You have that right.
My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.
The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
I'll fight for you, my Lady.
It'll be my honor.
The honor should be mine.
Make the bad man fly!
Ser Vardis… You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
Agreed.
You demanded a trial by combat.
Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait.
The trial will be today.
Do I have a volunteer?
Anyone?... Anyone?
I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
I'll stand for the dwarf.
More wine, your Grace?
Oh, what was I saying?
A simpler time.
It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?
It was, your Grace.
The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.
Sounds exhilarating.
Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?
Once, I think.
You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”
Those were some lucky girls.
You ever make the eight, Barristan?
I don't believe so, your Grace.
Those were the days!
What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.
I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
Brigands, most likely.
They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.
Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner.
None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -
It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
Wel…
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.
You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
As you command.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
Grand Maester Pycelle.
My Lord.
Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
Is it over?
You don't fight with honor!
No. He did.
Can I make the little man fly now?
Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
A Lannister always pays his debts.
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south.
It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
My mother isn't from the North.
I'm aware of that.
Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
Yes. I have hair.
I've never seen it.
Would you like to?
No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?
I come from a very small village in -
Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care.
Sansa -
Septa.
Now you are being rude.
My prince.
My prince.
My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
There's nothing to forgive.
You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day.
Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
Going to King's Landing.
In a turnip cart?
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
And you can afford that?
Some of my friends are more generous than others.
There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
I'll have lots of company…
Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
Don't be a fool.
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon.
Let me see it one more time?
See what?
I'm going to miss you!
I know.
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
What?!
Listen -
What about Joffrey?
Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
What? No.
Please, Father. Please don't.
You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
Can't we take Syrio back with us?
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
Seven hells.
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -
I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father.
He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.
Wait!
Come on!
It's not fair!
Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.” “Joffrey Baratheon… golden-haired.”
Daenerys! Where's my sister?
Stop him.
Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.
Come.
Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!
Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
That is no place for a king.
You are no king.
Keep away from me!
Viserys, please.
There she is.
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.
Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
What's he saying?
He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.
That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.
No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!
Look away Khaleesi.
No.
No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!
Dany please!
A crown for a king.
Khaleesi…
He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain
Attacking him was stupid.
Lannisters don't act like fools.
Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Why is he still alive?
Tyrion?
Ned Stark.
One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
It wouldn't have been clean.
Clean...
You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
Now that's what you want people to think of you.
It's the truth.
When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
Of course it bothers me.
The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.
So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!
Hmm.
You're in pain.
I've had worse, my lady.
Perhaps it's time to go home.
The South doesn't seem to agree with you.
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
Has he done this before?
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
Your brother Or your lover?
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
My son saw you with him.
Do you love your children?
With all my heart.
No more than I love mine.
And they are all Jaime's.
Thank the Gods.
You've always hated him.
Hated him? I worshiped him.
When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.
I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
Oh, but it was.
Come here.
No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
Yes, My Lord.
Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.
Why don't you join us, My Lord?
I'm saving myself for another.
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
A stupid saying.
She must be very beautiful.
No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.
I do believe my lordo s in love.
For many years. Most of my life really.
Is she still married to him?
Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
And what do you want?
Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.
You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
Where is it you come from?
The Iron Islands.
They far away?
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
And what's that?
Lord.
Why?
Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
I will be lord after my father.
So you're not lord now?
No, you... You having a go at me? Is that it?
I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.
I'm not a Southerner.
You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.
Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.
I thought she was our prisoner.
Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
I'm used to worse than him.
I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
Why did you come here?
Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.
Why? What are you afraid of?
There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
Owls and Shadowcats and...
I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.
The "things" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.
They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.
I miss girls.
Why is he alone?
One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...
There's no rider.
Whoa, boy, whoa.
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Ned! It's Robert.
I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.
Robert, my sweet...
Out, all of you!
You damned fool.
Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
Give it to the council after I'm dead.
I will.
And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.
I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
My memory.
Give him milk of the poppy.
He was reeling from the wine.
No man could have protected him from himself.
I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
His squire, from the king's own skin.
His squire? The Lannister boy?
Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.
His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
I'm afraid those birds have flown.
The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.
According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.
The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.
The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.
Not dirt. Lands.
Lands, yes...
Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
It's not a chair. It's a...
A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.
A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.
Can't you help me make him understand?
The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
And because he had dragons.
Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
You don't believe it.
Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.
Well, I'll come with you.
No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.
Psst, Jorah the Andal.
Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!
My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
My Lady, you are from Westeros.
You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
Princess.
Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
That? Dornish swill.
You honor me, Ser.
The honor...the honor is all mine.
Huh-uh, huh-uh.
You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Rakharo.
Huh.
Is something wrong?
I have a thirst. Open it.
The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.
Open it.
Pour.
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
Do as he says.
As the princess commands.
Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.
You first.
Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
You will drink.
Khaleesi! Stop him!
Come.
Here you begin anew.
I do, my lord.
You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.
Yes, my lord.
You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.
my lord, might I go as well?
Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?
No, my lord.
The Night's Watch is my house now.
As you wish, lad.
Rangers with me.
Builders!
Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.
Do you take me for a servant?
We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.
May I go?
As you wish.
Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.
Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.
Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.
I always wanted to be a Wizard.
She won't care.
And what should I do with a hundred swords?
Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.
What about Stannis?
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
Stannis is your older brother.
This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.
Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.
Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
You will sail to dragonstone tonight.
Yes, My Lord.
Now leave us.
My Lord protector.
The King has no true born sons.
So when the King dies...
The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.
So it would seem. Unless...
There is no "unless".
And he cannot take the throne without your help.
Do you have a shred of honor?
You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
We?
You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.
What you suggest is treason.
Only if we lose.
Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy..
No. I won't do it.
So it will be Stannis and war?
There is no other choice. He is the heir.
So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.
You promised Catelyn you would help me.
Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.
He will not have my son.
Moon of my life. Are you hurt?
Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.
Liar!
You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.
You think he stands alone?
Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.
Men of the Watch!
I want no bloodshed.
Now!
I did warn you not to trust me.
Yah! Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
Hush! Go back to your room.
What is it? What's happening?
Do as I told you. Run!
This way! Left, right.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only 'cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
I was so. I watched, but you...
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
Arya Stark, come with us.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel.
Foreign bastard.
And you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Bloody oafs.
Be gone now, Arya.
Come with me. Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the God of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today. Not today.
Stay away from me.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
What do you want?
I want you, wolf girl. Come here.
Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
She'll reward me, the Queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn't poisoned.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
And Sansa?
Still engaged to Joffrey.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, My Lord.
The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.
Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.
The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother sadly.
If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, My Lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
The Realm, My Lord.
It's Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.
Mmm.
The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
We should burn them.
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You heard him.
Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.
Come on, move 'em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
I'm sure they'll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.
No, I'm not.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.
Robb.
Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...
You disappoint me, child.
I only meant that...what will happen to him?
That depends.
On...on what?
On your brother. And on you.
Treason? Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?
This is a royal command, My Lord.
I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.
I'm hungry.
Hush now, darling. You just ate.
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
But I'm hungry!
Soon, love, soon.
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.
And feed it to the goats, yes.
Uncle. Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these Companions of yours?
This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.
You wouldn't know him.
May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.
You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He's been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
Is our hostage.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark's son has called his banners.
A green boy.
Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
At once, My Lord.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Only if the half man fights with us.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.
Robb's right.
So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
Don't worry, lad.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
How high did you get?
20,000. Maybe more.
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.
Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.
Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...
Ser Aron.
Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.
Lord Gyles.
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?
You let my father die.
Your Grace...
The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!
Careful, Ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
A naked Knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, My Lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
Let her speak.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father's crime?
No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.
He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
A childo s faith Such sweet innocence.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
He will.
You've seen better days, my lord.
Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.
l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord.
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.
What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?
Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
Robb? He's just a boy.
Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.
Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?
lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.
Have my horse saddled and ready.
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.
l agree. l'll go.
You can't!
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
Unless there was a profit in it.
What do you want?
lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?
Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?
Father, please –
l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.
ls there somewhere we can talk?
We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
l'm sure she will give you many sons.
Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
He is quite ill, my lord.
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.
My lord, l –
Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
l'm sure there were reasons –
l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
Why should l let him?
lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.
There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.
You swore an oath to my father.
Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.
Why don't you?
Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?
And engage!
When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
Soon, he says.
Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.
This is Valyrian steel.
lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
My lord, you honor me, but l can't –
Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?
Yes, my lord.
Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.
l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.
Well done. Well done.
You earned that, Snow.
Well done.
Go on, let's have a look.
At what?
The sword! Show us the sword.
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
Let's have a look.
Piss off.
Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!
Look at its eyes.
What is it?
l - l can't.
You can't what?
l'm really not supposed to say.
And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
What? What about him?
He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.
l should be there. l should be with him.
lf we do that, they'll never get back across.
Well? What did he say?
Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.
Huh.
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
What does he want in return?
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
Fine, fine. And?
And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
She won't be happy about that. And?
And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
l did.
And?
One was – Do you consent?
Can l refuse?
Not if you want to cross.
Then l consent.
Sam said you wanted to see me?
l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?
No.
So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
He would do whatever was right, no matter what.
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?
Sam told you.
We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.
And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.
You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South
Who are you?
My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.
You're Aemon Targaryen.
l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.
My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
My horse…
Blood of my blood…
No, l must ride.
He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.
This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
You do not command me, Khaleesi.
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
Hyah! Hyah!
Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.
The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.
Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.
l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.
Shagga likes axes.
When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
They do seem rather ferocious.
Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
l took her.
Took her? From whom?
From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
And he didn't have anything to say about it?
He said something.
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.
Who are you?
Who would you like me to be?
What did your mother call you?
Shae. What did your mother call you?
My mother died giving birth to me.
ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
What sort of accent is that?
Foreign.
For-
What do you want from me?
What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.
And what do l get?
One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.
Who told you this? Women you paid?
And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
Let's start with your last night in this world.
Khaleesi.
Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
l won't leave him.
He's already gone, Khaleesi.
Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.
This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
The wound has festered.
You did this, witch.
Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.
l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.
l think you're right.
You've saved me once more.
And now you must save him.
He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
Do it. Save him.
There is a price.
You'll have gold, whatever you want.
lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
My death?
No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.
Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.
Kill her and you kill your khal.
This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.
l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
Go. Now.
Take her and leave. Take her!
You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.
No one will enter.
Bring him back to me.
l have to save him.
This must not be.
This must be.
Witch.
Nothing good will come of this.
No, you can't.
Khaleesi!
No further, horselord.
Are you hurt?
The baby –
Hmm?
is coming.
Fetch the midwives.
They will not come. They say she is cursed.
They'll come or l'll have their heads.
The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.
Are you in agony, my lion?
No.
You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?
Just used to it.
Drink.
Let's play a new game.
There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Not if you win.
No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.
What are you good at?
l happen to be a great judge of character.
This sounds like a boring game.
lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.
l don't want to play this game.
Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
But my mother hit harder.
You killed your first man before you were 12.
lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
You've been north of the Wall.
What brought you up there?
Work.
And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
l don't want to play.
lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
Drink.
All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
And we've established the rules about lying?
Drink!
You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?
Are you sure –
Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.
My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.
My turn.
Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
Who were you in love with?
That's not how the game works.
l don't care the way the game works.
Our lord here used to be married.
Married?
How did you hear that?
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
Another night, perhaps.
Not another night. This night.
lt's not a pleasant story.
Oh, maybe l will cry.
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.
For three chickens, l should hope so.
lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.
Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.
Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
l would have killed the man who did that to me.
You should have known she was a whore.
Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
As l said, l was young and stupid.
You are still young and stupid.
What is it? What do you want?
You're sleeping through the war.
What?
They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
Get my squire!
You don't have a squire.
lf l die, weep for me.
You'll be dead. How will you know?
l'll know.
Watch out! Move!
Out of the way! Move aside!
Stay low.
Stay low?
lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.
l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!
Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
To battle!
You're a shit warrior.
l'm alive?
You're alive.
Did we win?
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
How did our tribesmen do?
Yeah, good.
lt's nice to see them getting along.
You're wounded.
Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
He wasn't here.
Where was he?
With his other 18,000 men.
And where are they?
We should go, my lady.
No!
My lady!
Hyah! Hyah!
By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.
lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
l've lost them too, l'm afraid.
Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
He's more use to us alive than dead.
Take him away and put him in irons.
We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.
lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.
Come on, pretty man.
l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
Three coppers.
How about a nice fat pigeon?
Oh, piss off now. Go on.
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
Piss off!
Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?
They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
Who?
The Hand of the King.
Traitor! Coward!
Baelor!
Traitor! Traitor!
I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say
As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
No, stop! Please, someone stop him!
My son, this is madness.
Put him down!
Don't look!
Let me go.
Shut your mouth. Look at me.
Stop him, stop!
Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut, boy.
l'm not a boy!
You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north.
lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.
You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.
You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.
You see? He's not here.
Here, Shaggydog.
Rickon!
That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
He doesn't like chains.
What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.
No, l came to see Father.
How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.
He was down here. l saw him.
Saw him when?
Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.
You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that –
Bran…
My lady. My lady. My lady.
Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
Shh! Shh! Shh!
l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.
Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?
Your Grace?
Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
Good. Tongue it is.
Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.
Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
l beg you! Please, no. No!
Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! No!
l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
Your Grace, please!
You look quite nice.
Thank you, my lord.
Your Grace. l'm King now.
Stop! No!
Walk with me. l want to show you something.
Do as you're bid, child.
And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.
No! Please, no!
This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
You promised to be merciful.
l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.
Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –
Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!
Well?
How long do l have to look?
As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?
lf it please Your Grace.
That's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.
Or maybe he'll give me yours.
Here, girl.
Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.
Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.
You'll be needing that again.
The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
Renly is not the king.
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.
That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis…
My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!
l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!
Am l your brother, now and always?
Now and always.
My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
The King in the North!
The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
Lady Stark.
l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
Leave us.
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman.
l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.
That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.
But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?
Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
Because of men like you.
There are no men like me. Only me.
My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
l pushed him out the window.
Why?
I hoped the fall would kill him.
You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?
Stop talking. Get back into bed.
They have my son.
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
ls it true about Stannis and Renly?
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.
There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
l'm told we still have his sisters.
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
Kevan Lannister
They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong.
Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.
No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
And do what?
Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…
Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?
You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?
Ser Jorah?
Gently, gently.
My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
The boy did not live.
Tell me.
What is there to tell?
How did my son die?
He never lived, my princess. The women say –
What do the women say?
They say the child was –
Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.
Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.
Time enough for that later –
l want to see him now.
The khalasar is gone.
A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.
Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.
This is not life. When will he be as he was?
When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
Leave us.
l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.
lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
l spoke for you. l saved you.
Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
Your life.
Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.
You can't!
Get out of my way, Sam.
They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
Better than you do.
What are you going to do?
l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
You can't leave us now. We need you here.
Move.
l won't let you go.
No.
Hyah!
Hand of the King?
So it would seem.
And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?
No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.
He knew my name?
What?
He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?
l believe he used the word "whore".
Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?
I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.
My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –
l know what a Hand needs.
Ghost?
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Samwell!
ls he dead?
No, he's not dead.
Did we get him?
Come on, help me get him up.
Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.
l belong with my brother.
But we're your brothers now.
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.
They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.
But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.
l have to.
You can't. You said the words.
I don't care about –
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow
To hell with all of you.
Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.
l am the sword in the darkness –
l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.”
Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is – For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal – powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.
He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.
So what's the thing?
What thing?
About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".
What? Things? What?
When you started, you… Never mind.
Let me see you out, my dear.
lt's all right. No need.
Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right.
When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
Oh, you can do better than that.
When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.
Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.
Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.
A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.
So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
Playing our roles.
Serving a new King.
Long may he reign. My king.
My king.
My lords. Shall we begin?
You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, ‘cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?
Arry.
You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time – men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
Watch yourself, midget.
He's got a sword, this one.
What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
Maybe he's a little squire.
He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.
Let's have a look.
l could use me a sword like that.
Take it off him.
Give it here, midget.
Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?
lt was a gift.
lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.
Which are you?
Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.
Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!
Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
My friends brought me back.
l didn't say it was your honor.
They killed my father.
And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?
No.
When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?
Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
Beyond the Wall?
l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
ls this your command, Khaleesi?
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
They were not given to me to sell.
Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.
l must. You don't understand.
Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.
You will not hear me scream.
I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
Blood of my blood.
Well struck… Well struck, Dog.
Did you like that?
It was well struck, Your Grace.
I already said it was well struck.
Yes, Your Grace.
Who's next?
Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
Here I am. . Here I am. . Sorry, Your Grace. . My deepest apologies. .
Are you drunk?
No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.
Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup.
Are you sure, Your Grace?
Yes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like.
I would be honored, Your Grace.
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.
You can't!
What did you say? Did you say I can't?
I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.
Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.
He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool.
Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you.
Beloved nephew.
We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.
What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me.
Can't imagine why.
We heard you were dead.
I'm glad you're not dead.
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.
Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!
But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.
Of course you are.
Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.
What work? . Why are you here?
The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.
The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.
A common superstition.
We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants.
The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.
You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
I do, Your Grace.
And are you not a Lord at my command?
I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.
Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.
Yes, Your Grace.
Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.
What are you doing here?
It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.
What are you doing here? This is the small council.
Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.
Our father is Hand of the King.
Yes, but in his absence…
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .
I've done nothing.
Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
I tried to stop it.
Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
Robb Stark is a child.
Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
What do you know about warfare?
Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
Joffrey is King.
Joffrey is King.
You are here to advise him.
I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.
How?
You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
One.
One?
Arya, little animal, she disappeared.
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.
The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.
Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.
King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.
Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?
Of course I remember!
We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
I - I believe it will.
We didn't want him here all day, did we?
I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.
My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.
Don't have any pain.
Lucky for you.
That way.
You've been having those dreams again.
I don't dream.
Everyone dreams.
I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.
The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.
The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.
What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
He said they ate meat.
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?
My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
She was Drogo's first gift to me.
I remember.
I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.
Does it ever end?
This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.
And you're sure there's no other way?
If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
No one will take my dragons.
They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.
As you are mine.
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.
What do we seek, Khaleesi?
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
You never have.
This is… bad time to start.
Having a rough time of it?
Nothing's killed me yet.
Your ass killed the sledge.
You offered me a ride!
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times.
Are those girls?
Craster's daughters.
I haven't seen a girl in six months.
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.
What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?
He don't like people messing with his wives.
He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes.
That's foul.
It's beyond foul.
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.
What happens to the boys?
Hmm?
He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.
We're not Southerners.
Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?
Jon Snow.
Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.
The lad meant no harm.
I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -
No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth.
You bring any of that good wine with you?
We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.
There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.
Yes, commander.
You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.
He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!
Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.
He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?
That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?
Give it here.
You'll have another one made at Castle Black. . Here.
Oh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.
And where does he plan marching this army?
When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.
This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.
Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?
We chose different paths.
Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.
A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.
Your roof, your rules.
Who am I? Who am I?
Lord commander.
And who are you?
Who are you?
Your steward.
You want to lead one day? . Then learn how to follow.
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods.
Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed.
We need to stop her!
The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.
Not now.
And the dead shall rise in the North.
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.
In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.
Lord, cast your light upon us!
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
For the night is dark and full of terror.
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.
King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth…
What's the truth?
And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le-”
He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me.
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.
A lie. Take it out.
That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth -"
Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.
And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.
Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. . Let all true men declare their loyalty.”
When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -
I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
He has no need for ships.
I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.
I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?
Don't.
A cup of wine to honor the one true God.
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.
King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.
If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”
You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.
Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?
You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.
You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.
My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
No, but he's starting to know me.
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
It's better than three defeats.
This city stinks Like dead bodies.
A bit corpsey, yes.
And shit.
I thought you wanted to come here.
I love it.
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
And cum and garlic and rum.
You can smell cum from the balcony?
I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
And so did the country.
This is where I belong.
Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.
No one will know.
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.
What about you?
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.
Lord Baelish.
Your Grace.
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
Of course, Your Grace.
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
Curious.
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.
Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?
A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?
Yes.
Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.
When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.
And which truth is that?
Knowledge is power.
Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
You're Ser Alton Lannister?
I am, Your Grace.
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.
An honorable request, Your Grace.
Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
The King in the North.
King in the North.
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.
These are... Your Grace, these are...
These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.
A word, Your Grace?
You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
It's not so bad once you get used to it.
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?
Of course they are.
We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
Men who fought my father.
Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
I need his ships. They say he has 200.
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.
I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.
You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?
It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
You can't go to Winterfell.
I beg your pardon?
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
Why in the name of all the Gods -
Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.
I will ride at first light.
We will all be together again soon, I promise.
You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
Give Lord Renly my regards.
King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
What is all this?
Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
We can't find Arya Stark.
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.
Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
The King does not ask
His life is in danger.
We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
What are you asking?
I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. . That will be all, Mother.
No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
Haystack Hall.
Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. . Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
Littlefinger's a fancy man.
Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.
She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
She's beautiful.
She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. . Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.
You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.
Orders.
Whose orders?
Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
No, you can't!
No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
Give it here.
Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room.
Gendry! His name is Gendry.
Where is the bastard?
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!
Where?
They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!
How will we know him?
He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.
Find him.
OPEN
What are you doing here?
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.
You brought this on yourself.
I've done nothing.
Do you understand we're losing the war?
Does it ever end?
Everything ends, even the red waste.
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here.
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.
He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.
What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?
My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
We won't beat them until we take King's Landing, and we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them.
Men who fought my father.
I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
I need his ships.
He is not trustworthy!
I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime… and you. Father had other children?
What are you asking?
How many bastards does he have running around?
Where is the bastard?
The Night's Watch! Heading North!

SEQUENCE
Boy.
Lovely boy.
What do you want?
A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.
I have friends.
Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. . You're called Arry. . This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.
Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!
You should have asked nicely.
Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
The boy has more courage than sense.
Come here!
Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
They don't scare me.
Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.
What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
What are you doing?
They're looking for me.
You're in command here?
You're a long way from home.
I asked you a question.
Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.
I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
We're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
My lord.
You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.
We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
It was quite a battle.
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
And I tell him the story of how we meet.
To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
How can you tell?
I can always tell.
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.
How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.
I don't like threats.
Who threatened you?
I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
Ned Stark was a man of honor.
And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
I will, Your Grace.
Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.
Safe travels, cousin.
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
If that's everything?
A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
Trouble with the wildlings?
That's why they're called wildlings.
Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.
Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.
The northerners are a superstitious people.
According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie.
How do you kill a dead man?
Apparently you burn him.
One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.
We fart when we die?
My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?
We were having a serious discussion.
Would you look at that.
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
I prefer watching them come towards me.
I'm sure that's nice too.
Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed.
You were with her? How many times?
Well, as many times as I could.
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.
No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?
You shouldn't touch me.
Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. .
You're very brave.
What're you doing?
This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.
Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?
Sam said you could help.
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -
She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave.
What? .
I know it sounds a bit mad.
No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -
Sam we can't take her -
Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.
It's just not possible.
I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…
If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.
Why did you do that?
Do what, ask her a question?
You were cruel.
Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
I didn't touch her!
No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.
We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.
Khaleesi.
You don't need to see this.
He is blood of my blood.
Who did this?
Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.
They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
No! They killed his soul!
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
Is it as you remember my lord?
Looks smaller.
Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
Who will?
Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.
I love the cold and wet.
They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world.
Then you'll be king before long.
Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better.
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
I don't blame him.
He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-
Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.
Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
Your place is on this ship.
Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
I haven't paid you.
I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.
One moment, my friend. A moment.
Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
I'm sorry, my lord.
Shhh. Did he hurt you?
No, my lord… It's Mhaegen.
Who?
She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.
Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.
You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy.
More wine?
Damn it, boy!
Apologies, my lord.
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?
You know your wines, my lord.
That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.
Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
Wars have been started for less.
I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.
Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
Orders are orders.
Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
I never said they were the queen's orders.
No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.
You know your sister better than I do.
You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
I don't listen to filth.
That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. .
I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.
You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.
Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -
The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
No, we shan't.
There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.
The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
Boys?
I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!
To the new Commander.
If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?
Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.
I'm not afraid of no battles.
If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
Liar.
I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
Two men fighting isn't a battle.
They had armor on.
So?
So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
No, it isn't.
What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
It's when they've got armor on.
Now who told you that.
A knight?
How'd you know he was a knight?
Well, cause he got armor on.
You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .
How'd you know?
Cause I sold armor.
What do the gold cloaks want with you?
No idea.
You're a liar.
You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions.
No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
Who asked questions?
The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.
Lord Stark.
See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.
What did they ask about?
My mom.
Who's your mom?
Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
And who was your father?
He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?
I'm not a girl!
Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.
That's true. You're still a girl.
I am not!
Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.
I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
They won't. Not from me.
My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -
You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.
Do not call me milady.
As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike.
What you carrying?
Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .
I need to get to Pyke.
I'll find you a horse.
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
I bet you can.
You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?
None like you.
You don't know what I'm like.
You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.
Have my things sent up to the castle.
You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.
Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?
Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.
Is that an offer from my future king?
An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.
I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
Father.
Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?
A man. Your blood and your heir.
We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.
Lord Stark is gone.
And how do you feel about that?
What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?
Gold.
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.
My blood is salt and iron.
Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.
The offer he makes, is one I proposed.
He heeds your counsel?
I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.
No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?
I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
I will lead the attack myself.
Oh, you will?
I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
My dear.
Yara?
So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
She can't lead an attack!
And why not?
You're a woman!
You're the one in skirts.
This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.
What's dead may never die.
No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.
You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
Who said anything about the Lannisters?
You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?
Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
And yet, they both have larger armies.
Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
Mind your words, pirate. .
Matthos.
You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.
That's a promise that always comes true.
As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong
Only the clever ones.
You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
It is. .
One thing, I want the queen.
The queen?
Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.
This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.
As if she would just let you!
You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.
I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.
I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
You believe your king can win?
He is the one true king.
You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.
Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
When will the King have a sail?
As soon as his God wills it.
He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read.
Oh you and your mother.
It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!
But you always came home.
I wasn't praying.
But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.
You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
Don't tell him that.
Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?
Ha, the people. You think I care?
You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it.
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.
He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.
I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.
I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me.
As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.
You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.
She was my mother too.
Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. .
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
How did it fare with your pirate?
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
Does seem the wiser choice.
It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.
Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.
At once, Your Grace.
The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.
Come.
What did you say to him?
I told him death by fire is the purest death.
Why?
Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
Yeah.
These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
Tell your lord to burn them then.
I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
You must have faith.
Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.
Then we must be the ten.
I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.
I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.
You must give... all of yourself.
I have a wife. I took a vow.
She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King.
A son?
Out, all of you.
This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!
I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.
Wait outside.
Lord Commander-
Now!
Lord Commander-
Leave us.
What did you do?
I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
What business is that of yours?
No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...
You know.
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster.
I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.
Don't lose it again.
Gilly.
You're leaving.
I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.
I can't take it.
Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
You, you shouldn't give it away.
I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
Hodor.
Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.
Every night it's the same.
I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories.
So she was lying? They don't exist?
Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream.
What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.
All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
Loras! Highgarden!
Get him!
Oh!
Yield! I yield.
Well fought. Approach.
Rise. Remove your helm.
You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.
That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.
Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.
What?
I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.
You are most kind.
My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.
Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.
My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.
Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.
Your Grace.
Gerard. How's your foot?
Better, Your Grace.
They don't know their own size is all.
Good man.
I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.
Why?
Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.
At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?
That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.
If you'll follow me, my lady.
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.
What are you doing here?
I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?
You lying bitch.
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.
Father.
Father.
The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.
Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
I've always wanted a castle.
And what's my role in all this?
You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.
I'm to fight fishermen?
Be careful of their nets.
Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.
They won't even know we're there until it's too late.
What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.
Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.
What are our words? Our words?
We do not sow.
We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?
You gave me away!
Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
You'd have our father bow down to your other family?
I have no other family.
Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.
You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-
Keep your voice down.
Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!
I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
Again, only temporary.
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
Scullion? What is a scullion?
Kitchen wench.
A kitchen wench?
Yes, but-
Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?
Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
I'm the weakness?
It's a compliment, my lady.
How is being a weakness a compliment?
Language can be a bit tricky here.
Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
Soon, darling, when the war is over.
Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.
The princess just spoke to you.
Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
He might.
Would you like that?
No. I don't think so.
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?
Come in.
Who are you?
I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
No.
What are you doing?
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
What things?
Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
No.
You said to brush your-
Not now.
Your chamber pot is empty.
Clean the table.
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
Yes.
For whom?
Lady Zuriff.
Lady Zuriff
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
She wasn't in this city.
I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.
Do you want me to leave?
Just brush my hair.
Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
Please.
Thank you, my lord.
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
Why, yes, of course, my lord.
These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
Matrimony, huh? Yes.
I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.
I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
But remember, the Queen mustn't know.
Ooh. "The Queen mustn't know." I love conversations that begin this way.
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.
Precisely.
Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
But remember, you must tell no one.
Tell no one what?
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
Who better?
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?
The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.
Harrenhal is cursed.
Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?
Good. Oh. And remember-
The Queen mustn't know.
That must hurt.
What? What is it?
A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
Brienne is a very capable warrior.
And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
I'll make it up to you.
No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
And Margaery's a virgin?
Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.
As is your right. You are a king.
You look very beautiful.
Thank you, Your Grace.
It's a lovely gown.
You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.
You certainly don't need it.
Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
Must be the wine.
Here, let me.
I'm sorry.
Do you want my brother to come in and help?
What?
He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.
Whatever you need to do. You are a king.
You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
Dorne is the safest place for her.
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
She'll be a hostage.
A guest.
You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
It's done, Cersei.
No.
You cannot stop it.
No!
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
Get out! Get out!
Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
I would.
Kneel.
Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
What is dead may never die.
What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.
And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.
Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.
Leave me out of your next deception.
Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
Find him?
Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
What is the meaning of this?
No, please, please.
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.
I am your loyal servant.
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.
See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.
The eunuch has spies everywhere.
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
No, no, no.
There are no goats, halfman.
Well, make do.
How long have you been spying for my sister?
All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
I don't like his beard.
What? What?
Oh, no. No.
How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?
Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert.
So you poisoned him?
No. Never.
But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
Lannister, I always served Lannister.
Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!
For your trouble.
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
Good. One of my better ideas.
And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.
The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?
Why, am I about to hear one?
Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?
Depends on the sellsword.
Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
He has a sword, the power of life and death.
But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?
I've decided I don't like riddles.
Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.
I can't sleep.
I don't like the taste.
Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.
What?
How do you sleep?
Same as most men, I think.
But you've seen things, horrible things.
Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister.
You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?
Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.
Get up.
Get up.
Keep out of sight, both of you.
No, I'm not afraid.
I can fight.
Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.
Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!
Come on, move, move!
It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.
If he ever gets out.
Loras Tyrell?
Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.
The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
They get spooked by their own shadows.
Shh. Do you hear that?
No.
There's something out there.
Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face.
I swear you pissed yourself. "Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"
There is something out there.
Yeah, don't even try me.
Rennick.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Rennick!
King in the North!
The King in the North!
Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.
I doubt it.
Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets. "A flayed man none."
My father outlawed flaying in the North.
We're not in the North.
We're not torturing them.
The high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
No, don't! Don't! Please!
Shhh.
The rot's set in.
No, don't! No, don't!
Shh.
Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.
The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now
No, you can't!
Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-
You'll die if she doesn't.
I don't want to be a cripple, please.
Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
Your men are not my men, my lord.
Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
No! You can't!
Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.
What's your name?
Talisa.
Your last name?
You want to know what side my family fights on?
You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
That boy lost his foot on your orders.
They killed my father.
That boy did?
The family he fights for.
Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
I have no hatred for the lad.
That should help his foot grow back.
You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
You're going to kill Joffrey?
If the gods give me strength.
And then what?
I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
So who will?
I don't know.
You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
First we have to win the war.
You never told me where you're from.
Volantis.
Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
He was unlucky that you were.
You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.
Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please
Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
Killing you would send your brother a message.
But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.
Leave her face. I like her pretty.
Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her.
If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.
What is the meaning of this?
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
The kind who serves his king, Imp.
Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.
Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
I'm punishing her.
For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.
You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?
I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
What are you doing here, dog?
Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
And? What is it?
Look inside, Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Happy nameday, Your Grace.
My nameday has passed.
We won't tell if you won't.
No. Her. Touch her.
Could you hit her?
My uncle sent you?
Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.
Hmm.
Use this.
Harder.
I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.
Please, Your Grace.
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out
Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.
Begin.
Harder!
Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
Your Grace.
Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
I'm a practical man.
Just not a loyal one.
And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?
You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head.
I would give priority to my head.
I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.
Lord Baelish.
All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.
Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.
I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.
If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.
The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?
You seem quite interested in our marriage.
Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.
You've never married, have you?
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.
This isn't your horse.
It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.
Qarth?
Three days to the east, on the sea.
Will they let us in?
They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.
What do you know of this place?
Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.
Go on!
You, keep moving!
Bring her about!
What kind of fire melts stone?
Dragonfire.
There's dragons here?
No, all the dragons are dead.
What's that smell?
Dead people.
Move.
Please, please, no, no! No.
He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that.
They take someone every day?
Does anyone live?
Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
How dare you?
You may have heard false reports.
You betrayed Ned.
Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
No, my lady.
Get out!
Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance
Have you lost your mind? Get out!
Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?
You have Arya, too?
Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
What do you want?
The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
You think I keep secrets from my son?
Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.
I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
Good faith?
What's this?
Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
Get out.
Get up, you dogs!
That's him, the one who picks.
The Mountain. What are you doing?
He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.
You.
Move, boy! Move!
Is there gold and silver in the village?
I don't know.
Gems?
I didn't see any.
Where is the Brotherhood?
I don't know. Please.
Which of the villagers aided them?
Who?
I-
I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-
I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!
Who helped him?
Ganes, the butcher, and his son.
That's better. You've been very helpful.
No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!
No! No! I told you everything! No! No!
Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread.
Polliver. The Mountain.
Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
Can that truly be you?
Who else might it be?
When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?
My own.
I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?
The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
Watch yourself, Renly.
No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.
You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.
Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?
That's twice I've warned you.
Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
We share a common enemy.
The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power.
For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.
Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.
Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors.
Would you believe I loved him once?
I thought we were welcome.
If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.
Horde?
My name is Daenerys-
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
You know me, my lord?
Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons.
And what should I call you?
Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.
The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
KING Qarth.
Qarth.
Might we see the dragons?
My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
I am not a liar.
Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.
Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
We have received you. Here we are, and here you are.
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
Khaleesi, please be careful.
Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.
Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-
Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken.
I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.
The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.
Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.
Our decision is final.
Very well. I invoke soumai.
I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.
Be it on your head.
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.
Is there gold or silver in the village?
I'm not from the village.
I don't know what that is.
You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
What's this?
We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.
Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
Cells are overflowing, my lord.
This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-
Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
You, do you have a trade?
Smith, my lord.
What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.
He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?
Safer to travel, my lord.
Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
My lord.
Your visits are too few, cousin.
Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant.
So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?
I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.
And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
As I said several times.
And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.
The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.
I am a knight!
An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
It's not my fault!
Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?
Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
I only meant I did as I was bid.
Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.
Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear.
No, I think not.
My lord?
You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.
Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command.
Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.
But her demands?
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.
You will?
Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.
Your Grace.
Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.
Fewer.
Pardon?
Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
Does he listen?
To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest
She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
I've lived within the law for seventeen-
I want you to be a smuggler this time.
Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?
The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
Cleaner ways don't win wars.
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.
If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.
And which are you?
Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.
Well, that must be very nice for you.
Do you love your wife?
I do.
Yet you have known other women.
Don't talk about my wife.
I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe.
And you will.
Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.
These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
They can't bar our passage.
Gods protect us.
There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.
You swear it?
By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
And the wording of this oath?
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.
And in return for my son's loyalty?
In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.
When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.
Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother.
Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.
Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
No! No.
Follow me!
You'll die for this.
No, wait, it wasn't her!
We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
Inside the king's tent - go
Now.
I won't leave him.
You can't avenge him if you're dead.
Over there, go!
Not that way.
We need to go home. Loras.
My lord, my lady.
Get out.
Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.
And you want that privilege for yourself.
You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.
There's no time for this.
Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis.
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?
Stannis.
I will put a sword through his righteous face.
You can't stay here.
He would have been a true king, a good king.
Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
Revenge.
I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.
You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.
He was very handsome.
He was, Your Grace.
Your Grace." Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.
Do you want to be a queen?
No. I want to be the queen.
Killed? By whom?
Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
Really? Who'd have thought?
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.
Whomever did it, I say well done.
It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.
Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
She'll be safer in Dorne.
Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.
It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.
So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.
It's important that we talk about this.
It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
It's wildfire.
Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?
No.
MThat's a lie right there.
It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.
I'm telling you the truth.
The smart money would be on more likely.
She's making wildfire.
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
I suppose there's only one way to find out.
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
When did she tell you this?
I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.
Swear to me on what?
On my life.
But I don't care about your life.
In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...
All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.
Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
It will be my pleasure.
Your Grace.
What is it?
I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.
Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.
I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
Your Grace, I-
I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
You've come to lecture me on truth?
I've come to tell you that what I saw.
All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron
I'll hear no more about it.
Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.
When do we sail for King's Landing?
As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
That's not your concern.
If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.
I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
Loyal service means telling hard truths.
Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?
She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
What do you believe?
You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.
Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.
I've got it! I've got it!
So it's that one there at the top, on the right.
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.
Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?
There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.
Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.
Corruption.
Yes!
We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.
It's hard to argue with his assessment.
Not after what he did to your birthday present.
The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
You have to admire his imagination.
He's talking about you.
What? Demon monkey?
People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
You don't need to convince me.
Demon monkey.
Yeah, come on.
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
Where are we headed, Captain?
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.
And who decides if we've done our jobs well?
I do. Your captain.
I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.
Stop. We yield.
Congratulations on your first command.
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow.
You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore.
Come on, I'll take you out.
Who are you?
Dagmer, your first mate.
Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
You're not.
And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?
No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-
Take me to my ship.
The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?
We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.
Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.
My wife's in Lannisport.
Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.
If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!
Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?
Maidenpool, my lord.
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
House Mooton, my lord.
And what is their sigil?
A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?
Good. One more time, where are you from?
Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
They call him the Young Wolf.
And?
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
And do you believe them?
No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.
Fetch that water.
A girl says nothing.
A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.
I was always a girl.
And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
I didn't have a choice.
You did. I did. And here we are.
A man pays his debts. A man owes three.
Three what?
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.
I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
A man has said.
The one who tortures everyone.
A man needs a name.
I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.
He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn.
When will he come?
The Halfhand does things in his own time.
My uncle told me stories about him.
Most of them are true.
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
Well, possible for the Halfhand.
Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.
There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.
About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.
The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.
Before I die, please, stop talking.
Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?
Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
Wildlings?
One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes.
And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.
But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?
Well I read it in a book.
I read it in a book.
Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah.
Take care, my lord.
I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "
Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.
My companion takes issue.
If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
To do what?
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
How much do you have?
If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
My lord, this man is insulting.
I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
My friend remains unconvinced.
He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.
We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.
This is a shit idea.
I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.
Dracarys. Dracarys.
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
Let him sleep, Doreah.
Yes, Khaleesi.
He loves you.
I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.
Thank you, my friend.
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
It is known.
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-
The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.
May he ride forever through the night lands.
Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.
You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-
She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi.
You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.
It sounds wonderful.
The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.
Please excuse me for a moment.
What are they doing?
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.
Or melt it. Very simple.
We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.
Not even when we leave.
Why not?
Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?
Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.
Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.
My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
What is the House of the Undying?
It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.
You watch over her.
Do I know you?
I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
Who are you?
I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power.
It looked like Stannis.
To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
In the shape of Stannis.
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
Will you stay there long, my lady?
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.
I never knew my mother.
I'm sorry.
My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
It's a bloody business.
What comes after is even harder.
Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
You mean to kill Stannis.
I swore a vow.
But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
I only held him that once as he was dying.
He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.
I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.
When the time comes, I will not hold you back.
Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night.
We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours.
Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.
Good.
Hodor.
